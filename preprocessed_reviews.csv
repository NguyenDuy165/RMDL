0,	not happy i was really unhappy with this i followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size it was way too small at 7 weeks postpardum im ten weeks postpardum and may try it again but it was a real selfesteem crusher initially im a size 0 prepregnancy and so i thought it was fair to order the xs but i guess not"
0,	causes bruising and blisters if worn too long i ordered this product to slim down my stomach i was looking for something i could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses i wore the squeem to work occasionally and then i would take it off when i got home when i would take it off i felt sore around my sides and my back i washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didnt one night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so i ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours that night when i took the squeem off i had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks im blackon my body i read other review before i purchased the squeem and i didnt see anything that alerted me not to buy it not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you dont say i didnt warn you"
0,	waste of money the inner metal rods keep poking through the squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best while the product compresses your stomach the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends i have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through at one point the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom it scraped my stomach and i took it off immediately i have never washed the product in the washing machinei have always handwashed it so the manufacturer cant say that i didnt take good care of it"
0,	a book for those with time on their hands if this book is so great then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone to the best of my knowledge only erudites and scholars enjoy this book a good book but one with a limited audience dont read it unless you dont mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences antiquicated words and flowery prose personally i like an author who gets to the point"
0,	the scarlet letter a soap opera although this book is considered a great work of literature written to describe the harshness of purtian new england plus this book was heavily laiden with symbolism and many other literary toolsthe scarlet letter is a soap opera and a bad one at that not only is it boring no true action occurs in this book nothing truly interesting happens in this book this boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison dooralthough the author did a creative job of conveying his point this is still the worst book i have ever read i would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages this is a good book to study however it is not a good book to read for pleasure under any circumstance"
0,	this edition is not complete this review refers to isbn 9781613823613 with no explanation or indication that it is doing so this edition leaves out the authors introductory chapter the customhouse admittedly the chapter is long tedious and skipped by many still it leaves the book useless for the classroom and lets face it who else is going to read it this isnt exactly light summer readingin addition there is no bolding of sat words with definitions in the margins that some reviewers mention which was the main reason i chose this edition in fact other than the abbreviated text there is absolutely nothing no forward no readers guide no author bio  nothing so not the most helpful textbookon the bright side it is wellbound and the type is quite easy to readi am returning the book and looking for a more suitable edition"
0,	broke the 2nd time i wore it great until then i think this product provided a great fit i was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max it wasnt quite as difficult to get on as i thought it might be although it isnt particularly easy either i tried it on and wore for about 2 hours and then the 2nd time i wore it had it on for about the same period of time i took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom this product is far too expensive to have something like that happen the fit on me was snug but i am sure i had the correct size now i have to figure out how to get this resolved"
0,	had to return it the sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right i am 52 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies i dont like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like i have back boobs the shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesnt feel smooth all over squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage if you do decide to purchase this product its easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts"

0,	vastly overrated work of fiction i was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery sure back then there was no google searching nor number crunching laptops but plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent probably the books greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences even with todays analytical resources economists are still all over the map on their predictions  conclusions on the other hand meteorologists seem to do quite wellnaturally the radical libertarians teabaggers  republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence i would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty  irrational"
0,	a historical gem whose title obscures its intent started laughing in the second chapterenjoyed the book after i realized that i wasnt going to learn anything new its obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first publishedand seeing that the pending insolvency of the us was as loudly shouted in the 40s as it is now was worth the price this book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the uskudos to whoever owns the copyright  now theres economics in action"

0,	disappointment at its extreme i had never read this author but knew of many who did when i read that this book was being made into a movie it seemed a good opportunity to read her before seeing the screen mess up her work now i pray that the screen does soi was extremely disappointed with this work it is unrealistic fails to capture the reader and at points when i should have been completely engrossed left me struggling with whether i wanted to pick it up i hope she has written better than this or else there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors availableher characters are not sympathetic they do not draw the readers attention and they are dull in overall scope i have too many other good books to read before i pick up another book from this author"
0,	1 and thats being generous i have read many of jack higgins books and this is the poorest so far in my humble belief as i travelled thro the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which mr dillon strolls thro the events at hand the story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story mr dillon is just to scifi im afraidthere is a quote at the start of the book and as i got near the final chapters i was starting to imagine that the author would be writing the finale of mr dillonthe quote readto tess who thinks its about timeauthor i think she may mean something else"
0,	another disappointment from higgins this novella stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and doublespaced lines reads like a screenplay treatment there is very little character development movielike dialogue and plenty of mindless action the ending is wholly unsatisfying and im led to believe that this is simply a setup for another book an author with some integrity would have placed edge of danger as part 1 of a 2part novelif you are deadset on reading edge of danger dont waste your money the cover price of is an insult and the deeply discounted  price will still leave you feeling rippedoff go to your local library in the morning and youll finish edge of danger in time for an early lunch just dont expect to have any appetite left"
0,	conspiracy theorist the author is very likely a kurdish nationalist not implausibly a quite supporter of the pkk as a communist he has no room for religion his analysis is misleading basically he runs after muslims under the banner of islamism he seeks to undermine the islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs the author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that islam does not work the author does not use objective scientific methods he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions read the book if you wish but with such qualifications in mind you may read it to understand how the bigots mind actually works"
0,	i wish adam sandler wasnt in this i should have known going into this movie having judd apatow a part of it would mean i would hate it however having adam sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a very hopeful chance the movie loses its true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible  crude jokes i have to say we didnt make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off it is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior i just dont believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior very disappointing"

0,	a lost author i have read all of the carpathian novels to date except one i very much enjoyed them at first but nothing ever gets resolved you would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced as for this book it is an offshoot of another carpathian novel about the jaguar line i was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females nothing not a word about the jaguar curse and why do the walls and ceilings change ideas introduced and left at that ms feehan went once again off on a tagent her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive i will not be buying any further books by this author what a shame"
0,	light reading light in substance a clich�d storyline based on the classic cyrano de bergerac this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for italian culture and cuisine but little experience in developing a story i can understand bruno and his passion for cooking but have no clue as to his passion for laura it seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde american how exotic her character is so underdeveloped we know shes studying art history and she enjoys brunos cooking with a passion thats about it and tomasso hes just the clich� for any oversexed mediterranean male who encounters foreign femalesits a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away that being said i will however check out this authors more recent novels he does seem to have a way with technical details hopefully his storytelling has caught up"
0,	more romance please and less mystery the reason i gave two stars when i usually give 5 stars for ms feehans books is bc this book was tooooooo mysterygothic genre rather than romance i really didnt feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroines point of view and i was getting sick of her whining and her point of view unlike the dark series you really didnt feel any passion the book is better suited for the mysterygothic genre and not romanceeven the mystery was not that good its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages throughout the entire book youre kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pagesms feehan if your reading please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery"

0,	not an ultimate guide firstlyi enjoyed the format and tone of the book how the author addressed the reader however i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal if you are just starting to research law school and do not know all the requirements of admission then this book may be a tremendous help if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions i recommend some more topicspecific books for example books on how to write your personal statment books geared specifically towards lsat preparation powerscore books were the most helpful for me and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation yet for those new to the entire affair this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you"

1,	best of the first four in this series this is an awesome book kay just keeps getting better and better its also fun to see the characters develop more with each book  kay herself as she seems to be always one against the world marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic in this book kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings it appears that a recently executed murderer who kay herself has seen on her autopsy table is still around committing crimes a number of murders occur where the executed murderers fingerprints are turning up kay marino and benton try to track a killer but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere this is a taut and totally believable thriller i cant wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment"

1,	the scarlet letter a must read for any american the best book that i have ever been assigned to read for school by far the way in which hawthorne captures the shame that hetser  the wearer of the scarlet letter feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with hester and the revenge ridden character of chillingworth is spectactularthe way in which hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader since hester the main character concieved her daughter pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet a on her chest for the rest of her life the story starts on the day hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of boston starts from there a must read for any american"
1,	the scarlet letter much to my amazement this book has been placed on banned lists in several states its an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear"
1,	great novel the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne is a great novel it takes place in boston massachusetts during the era when puritans were there the main character hester prynne is forced to wear a scarlet letter a for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from europethe book really recaptures what puritanism was like its interesting to think about what america would be like if we were still puritan a theme of the book is concealed guilt the minister arthur dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain the message of the book is that you shouldnt let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your lifethe book denounces the religious atmosphere of the puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of old england you get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of chaucer was lost in america due to the influence of the puritans"

1,	i recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size i ordered the squeem waist shaper in a size smallmy general size is 46 im 54 and weigh 120lbs right now over the winter i ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isnt much to complain about but i have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress i just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips i wish id ordered a medium or even large instead because as i was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time i tried to hook the lower 6 above my hips i dont want to be uncomfortable i just want a smooth finish so if youre similar in size i recommend ordering a medium instead in general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last"
1,	great product a friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress i brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but i needed a small it was extremely difficult to put on so i needed assistance once it was on i was still able to contract my core which meant that i needed a smaller size i believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso other then that this is great buy"

1,	black knight c2c heat squash racquet great racquet but im a power hitter i have no power generating difficulty with this racquet my style is to try to volleyball and everything ive found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered i like the factory grip although with distinct ridges others prefer a smooth grip may  give the factory grip on chance and you may come to like it the sale prices are right for a high about end racquet racquets and black knight in have a reputation for overall durability so you should get plenty of use before replacement note i got my first c2c as a d level player and did not like it immediately howeve as my game improved version i switched from my bandit black knight c2c white racquet to the great success and have had so it might not be the right racquet for a beginner intermediate to advanced players but will benefit from this fine racquet"

1,	an engrossing and chilling read my first foray into the novels of patricia cornwell has left me impressed the characters were intense and realistic my only concern is that the evil temple gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning why did he decide to trail and give gifts to dr scarpetta needless to say i will be reading more of cornwells books especially if they are at all like this novel"
1,	from potters field by patricia cornwell this was a very good book with excellent descriptions its a real page turner and keeps you wondering whats going to happen next the best parts are at the very beggining and the end"
1,	no another grill like this this grill is one of its kindit can be use anywhere without so much hard workit fits snugly anywhere"
1,	wonderful baffling mix this has just about everything the rabbi of course is learned and devout even if his schooling causes some nervousness the cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech the visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of smalltowners can summon and around all of that the monotonous drama of life unfolds loves losses and changes that no one knows how to ride outcomics have moved well past the bampow genre into many other idioms  this might border on chick lit but much less than some if reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you with deep family devotions and deeper or shallower personal ones the ragged lines of this comic might touch you wiredweird"
1,	does the job i have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasnt elastic based found this item and have to say i am pretty pleased the hooks do take a while but once they are all done the waist cincher does what it says it will do the only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about it does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms so i cant wear this with a top that is clingy can only wear with looser fitting shirts oh well nothing is perfect
