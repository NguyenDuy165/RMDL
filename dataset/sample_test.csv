1,Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!,"Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter..."
1,misleading photo,"There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the ""too good to be true"" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier."
1,Waste of money,"If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!"
1,What a waste!,After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
1,Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!,"Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 ""generations"" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS."
1,Confused,"I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first."
2,Great deliver of all products,Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.
2,"Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story","Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them."
1,Oh Romeo,Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
2,A good introduction to the tragedies.,"Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose."
1,RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!,"We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!"
1,Good book -- but not this edition,"This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version."
1,How do films like this get made?,"If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!"
1,What the Heck ???,"The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer's uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don't get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!"
1,"Cute, But a Little Cheap...","This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better."
1,Disappointed,"I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!"
1,"no color, no buy","I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I'd end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!"
2,Not classic Yello - but very very good!,"Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!"
1,Disappointed!,"Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? ""Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!""I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!"
1,A double edged sword,"This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson ""in his own words"" but were nothing more than fabrication."
1,MANSON HATES EMMONS.,"Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,""Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook.""The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual."
1,"Lies, Lies, Lies","For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it."
1,REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said ""man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system"" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I couldn't put it down,"Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable."
1,sadly predictable,"If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied."
1,Struggled Through!,"I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!"
1,Klaatu Hopeless,"I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However ""Hope"" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
2,A Must read,This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.
2,A unique take on a classic theme,"I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating."
2,One Brave Act changes a civilization,"this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing ""object"" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read"
2,GREAT Dali book .... Great Amazon price,"Love the book, love dealing with Amazon.com I've been dealing with Amazon for years now, and have never had a problem with them. THANKS ONCE AGAIN AMAZON."
2,Great space heater!,"It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it."
2,Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.,"After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of ""Portrait of a Marriage"" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call ""The Three V's."" The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge."
1,Buyer Beware!!,If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!
1,This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale,"Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration."
1,Worst scanner I've owned.,"I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The ""auto"" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do."
2,a childhood favorite,"In ""The Greengage Summer"" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended."
2,"Forget Belkin, look no further than the GUF320","This thing was easy to intall. I have a Dual 1.25 G4 Mac. No driver installations under Panther 10.3.3. If you're pre 10.2.X on a Mac you'll have to visit Iogear's website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn't have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market."
2,Great Book,"For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book"
2,Most Interesting Ending,"This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the ""natural disaster"" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too"
2,Afghan lovers unite,"This is a great new book from our friends at Liesure Arts, I had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos. I recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy."
1,complete nuisance,"I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box."
1,bad company,"The scanner looks nice but very deceiving, I bought this scanner because of the name Xerox.I had it for about 2 months and scanned maybe 100 sheets, now it died!Xerox after 3weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say I will get a refurbished unit. (Bad company)"
1,does not work,You get two sets of dice: one that always comes up 7 or11 and another set. Planned to have some family fun with it. Only fun we had was how it did not work at all. The 7-11 set comes up all kinds of numbers. What were they thinking with this item?
1,Decent player... while it lasts,After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
1,Poor substitute for an iPod,"Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap."
1,Yet another broken headphone jack.,"After roughly a year of fairly reliable use, I've also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack. Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (""limited"" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider ""fixing"", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I'm outright angry that I'm not alone."
2,Discontinued 70PD05500032?,"Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as ""Discontinued"". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion."
2,Top Notch Christmas Jazz,"I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD's. How did I miss this one for so long? It's a winner from begining to end. The Trio really delivers some tasty versions of your favorite Christmas standards. Each nugget features a unique take on the song without straying too far from the original sound. Very upbeat and lively thtoughout. Not your standard, elevator jazz."
1,review,"The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy, hard to follow."
1,Wow,"I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD."
2,"Basketball, not at its best","Ok, as yall might know me, im Gamer8. To the game. This game is sorta like the first NBA Street game for the PS2. It has some flaws, such as lighting. Also, at points of the game, you might say, is this game worth $50.00? Well, its worth about $30.00. 1.- Its not a good game for portability. 2.- Lighting is bad at times 3.-Can be hard for beginners. So I suggest that you must know what the first few NBA Street games are about before buying thsi title. PS:Its a fun game after a while"
1,never again,"I bought this heater and it didn't even work on arrival. The pilot light came on, but nothing else. What a waste of time and money."
1,Reaching for the Light,I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!
1,Hardly worth reading,"This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read."
2,Statin levels,"Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins, (Icluding monacolins KA form).The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label. They want everyone reliant on large pharma. This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption."
1,DECEPCIONADO,"Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería ""el libro"" para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil, lo primero que leí fue lo referente a estoa paises. QUE DECEPCIÓN!La idea del libro es excelente y seguramente la autora tuvo que viajar, leer y estudiar mucho, pero pienso que debió haber pedido ayuda a que revisaran sus capítulos personas conocedoras de cada país o región.Tiene muchos errores históricos, geográficos, culinarios y de ortografía del idioma original. Estoy preparando una lista de ellos que posteriormente enviaré.La felicito por su dedicación, perodes graciadamente el resultado no es del todo bueno.Hans Rio de Janeiro/Brasil"
1,"Excellent show, poor sound","Unfortunatelly the DVD is dissapointing for Tina's fans. The show is fantastic, but both Dolby Digital and DTS version of this DVD have one of the worst sounds I ever heard. My subwoofer didn't move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames. More, the soundtrack was re-edited with sound taken from other concerts (that's incredible - at one moment I swear that I heard the word Munchen despite the fact that the concert is in Amsterdam). And, oh yes, the DVD is overpriced. Forget ""Amsterdam"" and don't miss ""One Last Time in Concert"" as it has verry good sound quality and image. Not speaking abut the phantastic show..."
2,Northwinds - 'Great God Pan' (Black Widow),"Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work,but I'll try.A French progressive outfit that blends old school Sabbath with celtic music.Would that formula even fly?It does here.Notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on 'Great...'.A total of six cuts,with each one averaging eight minutes.Tunes I couldn't get enough of were the title track,""Great God Pan"",their Sabbath cover of ""A National Acrobat""(talk about covering an obscurity-great work!!)and the epic ""The Forest Of Koncerei"".A real keeper."
1,It does not use your classification for the musics.,"I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device."
1,Returned the View twice in one week,"I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems."
1,Worst mp3 player on the market.,"I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product. This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life. I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please, please do not waste your money & time on this product. I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it."
2,Nice Device,"This is a nice MP3. I got it on Black Friday on Amazon for only $99.99 , yes Sansa View 8 GB MP3 280. While everyone else was looking at the lighting rounds on Black Friday they didn't see the tiny small icons around the today's deal page. If you use a computer you should be able to tranfer sound & images files without using a program. It's basic computer 101. I use Sony's SonicStage myself. Records at 192 for crisp sound."
2,This player is very very good,"Wow, this has been one of the best products I bought, with great sound, great quality pictures in the video, easy to load files into memory, compatible with WMP, it also brings a player-Sync in the installation cd . I like, I take all Pareto, I plug in the car, sounds very hard, is extremely friendly to navigate between playlists. Presntacion has several languages''. The Spanish translation used is very good and relevant, unlike others who say one thing and mean another. I recommend"
1,Don't buy without a good return policy.,This player freezes constantly. It's possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don't buy without a good return policy.
1,Don't buy this piece of crap,"I bought this piece of crap and found out it's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So, I have basically a $200 radio. Worthless. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Nothing is from scratch?,"Why on Earth would ""nothing is made from scratch"" be a selling point for a cookbook? How horrid!For good, simple cooking, look into Mark Bittman's cookbooks."
2,Really funny and exciting,"I'd say this book is extremely informative for the responsible, occasional sit at home drug user. I read it and learned a few things about the law I didn't know about. Definately a must read for anyone who uses any drugs whether it be a little or a lot. If you're a dealer it gives you an outlook of legal information, but one of the author's commandments in the book is ""Thou shall not sell"" which every dealer already knows. The only rule for dealers is DON'T GET CAUGHT."
2,Good book,Good story and interesting characters..A lot of history in this story that I found to be interesting..the life of Indians has always fascinated me.
2,Great History,"I am a big fan of Ms. Blake's but this was not one of her better books. It dragged a lot at times but the history involved in the story more than made up for it. If you're a fan of people and their cultures, you might want to give this book a try."
2,Handy card holders,"I play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards, which, since I have small hands and am also a klutz, I drop a lot and mix up. The card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone. They are also slightly curved to prevent other players from ""accidentally"" seeing your cards. A very good deal for klutzes everywhere."
1,It does the job,"If you can't hold the cards, this will work but I believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box. The idea is to make it easier for the individual. It can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose. A block of wood will do better. The card holder shouldn't be a game within a game."
2,Buy this now!,"Very attractive, solid and sturdy, materials are very well organized. Not the cheapest, but well worth it -- especially at the discount Amazon provides... And then there's the content -- top notch stuff, perfect."
2,Forward the Mage an Alternate Style,"Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire, Swift and Sterne. This book set in ""Joe's World"" is the second book in this series. Although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading. Once read I was hooked into asking ""where is the rest of this story"", this is quite normal for this style of writing and I await eagerly the next volume."
2,Fantasy writing at its best,"Eric Flint and Richard Roach's Forward The Mage is fantasy writing at its best: an artist-swordsman faces an evil sorcerer, arrest, and politics when his artistic ambitions are rerouted in a struggle for survival. Both feature fast-paced action and complex, believable settings."
1,A device grows old,"Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap, but this book focuses on Gwendolyn, Benvenutti & the Sorcerer. Story of events in these characters' lives before, during, and after, Phil Strangler. Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time, and not as funny. If you loved Philosophical Strangler, you'll probably love this one, but if you were growing weary by the end of the Strangler, you should probably pass this one up."
2,Cool Documentary,"I was extremely excited to pop this DVD into my computer and watch it. But please be aware this is more like a documentary. And please don't let me deter you from buying this DVD.A lot of interviews about the the World Championship mixed with some GREAT interludes of the interviewee riding. Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states, this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through, not about their riding skill and extreme stunts. I expected non-stop action, but this is still a great DVD to add to my collection. I've watched it a few times just to watch them ride their riding chapters.A must buy for anyone serious about competitive DH racing. Shred it up all!"
1,Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships,"This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a ""Nimitz""-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a ""great"" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book."
1,Jabra Eargels,The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.
1,Jabra Ear Gels,"These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!"
1,What a waste,"Complete waste of $12.00. If they stayed in your ear they might be worth something, but good luck with that. In-ear earbuds work so much better than these."
2,"Fast delivery, great product","Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw."
1,JABRA EAR GELS,Save youself some money. The Jabra Ear Gels are an absolute waste. They actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from Jawbone.I was even more disappointed that I paid $4.63 shipping on a worthless $9.99 product. It's not even worth returning. Lesson learned. Hopefully you will also.
2,jabra eargels,These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
1,Don't waste your money,"They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them."
1,Not well suited for the Jawbone II,"When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all."
1,pain in the ear,"They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically, a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped."
2,JEG,The product arrived as expected. The ear gels fit the JawBone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.
1,scottiesgems,I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
1,Don't waste your money,"After ordering these eargels, I spent an enormous amount of time trying to make them fit. It was useless. Unless you have elephant ears, or you wish to grease them and use a hammer to insert them, they won't work."
1,This movie is not all that,"originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star, but because of one of the last scenes where ugly t(telemachus) threw two spears at once, i give it two stars. Everything was horrible to my opinion. The accents kept changing everything. If you read the book before you watched the movie, you would thinkt hat this was all a joke. So if anything just read the book by itself. So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T"
1,Hmmmmmmm,"I've seen better movies on The All News Channel. Odysseus was played very well, but his part was boring. As well as the rest of the movie. Scylla looks like 1930's cartoons.I drew better stuff in 1st grade.Every single scene looks so fake it isn't even funny. I can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm. I would not recommend this to anyone young or old. This movie isn't worth a penny in my book!"
1,"Crap, all crap","...you would have noticed how horrible the allusions are in this crap-that-calls-itself-a-movie. The characters were simply annoying; Telemakhos, the whiny school boy that cries whenever he doesn't get his way, creepy Athena, who's eyes are SUPPOSED to be gray, Penelope, who obviously has a more pleasureful time on the water on the beach than with her husband, and of course Odysseus, who would make me weep if he was my captain. The sets looked as if elementary school kids put them together, Scylla was a sock-puppet, and the shades were just sad. I have never in my life seen such crap and I hope you won't fall for these other 4-star reviews that make me want to PUKE!"
2,The Odyssey with Armand Asanti,I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.
1,"Great movie, but what's with the price?","I have seen this movie before, and was looking to buy it to show in my classroom, but...why the heck is it $99? It's good, but not THAT good!"
1,Very BORING,"This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see."
2,"Birds, Beasts and Relatives","As always, Gerard Durrell's works make me want to hop on a flight to Greece right now. His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again. Slow paced and funny, this enjoyable book put Corfu at the top of my list of places to go."
1,I Don't Think So!,"Quite often, bringing a classic story like ""Moby Dick"" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did."
1,The white whale isn't,The annimation for the white whale was lousy. The original with G. Peck is a classic & you can't do a remake to match it. The attempt to give underwater scenes with the white whale sending the ship to the bottom stunk.
1,Did not fit in ear,"I was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear, in fact, after trying for a couple of weeks, I could not tell which one was the R and which was the L as they both fit so poorly. The spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearing.I threw these out and purchased the Umbo earbud. Much, much better fit there."
2,Great Series opener,"I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all."
2,The Face of a Stranger,"Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory. This is a wonderful series and I would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book, ""The Face of a Stranger"" which is the first in the series, for a more complete appreciation of each following book."
1,Waste of time and money,"I have used this product in addition to the fogger and carpet powder. I have sprayed all furniture, bedding, hard to reach spaces,etc. And a month later I still have fleas. It is a major waste of time and money."
1,This is not a normal Mercedes Lackey book.,"When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows, without true substance (or reasons) to their actions. I couldn't find reasons to cheer for anyone. One problem is there were too many people to follow easily. Since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world."
1,I hope Frances Mayes Got A Lot of Money for the Rights...,"I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can't understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms, foolishly thinking that the movie would get better, and after that I was done. Another good thing about DVDs is that you don't have to be kind and rewind. It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR. This movie is right up there with Ishtar! Except worse!"
1,very much disappointed,"It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View."
2,A very sexy and entertaining film! 5 stars!,"A very sexy and entertaining film. Sure, this film is heartwarming and inspiring. It is also funny and pleasant. BUT it is also sexy, very sexy infact! And it is very enjoyable and entertaining. 5 stars!"
1,Terrible movie,"I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
1,Last time I let the Blockbuster guy recommend a movie....,"What a waste of two hours! As a romantic comedy, it falls short on both romance and comdey. As a movie trying to give over a lesson, it is trite, overdone, and poorly performed. The writing is unimpressive, the story is dull and far fetched, and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot. What was the point? They seemed to have forgotten to find one."
1,under the Tuscany Sun,"Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new, just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie."
2,Wonderfully Inspiring Movie!,"In this movie, as with life(usually),our ""plans"" from our ""beginnings"", don't work out like we think they will.[If yours have and you are one of the those living your dreams, twenty, fifty, etc. years later, I'm sure you are counting your blessings! ;)]Frances' ""new"" story begins when she acts on instinct instead of ""planning"" and thus life begins, rather unexpectedly to Frances, to have its own ""design"" for her life. She has her hopes and dreams for what her life will become. Little does she know she will get exactly what she asks for. However, as in true life, it may not be in the way you expect it.A truly, inspirational movie for anyone struggling through some tough times in your life. I can't tell you how many times I've seen it, but I probably couldn't use my fingers to count, even if I counted each of them twice!Also, must mention Diane Lane, Sandra Oh, you guys are the best!"
1,Diane Lane is great but skip this movie,Diane Lane is the only redeemable part to this lame effort.The film takes tremendous liberties with the plot from the book. Way way too much PC madness.A waste of time and money.
2,Canon NB-5L good for the XS200IS,"I think it's always best to get the actual canon battery rather than a ""replacement substitute"". The battery life so far is pretty good- at least 8 hours."
1,Here's what really happened...,"The John Houseman character from the excellent James Caan original version, jumped into a time machine with the intent of destroying the social commentary critical to multinational monopolies from the first film and spreading cultural plastics so prevalent in his future history. The result is dumbed down junk where you must give up the idea of wondering how movie executive's decisions are made. I think he did a good job."
1,"A failure of ""Battlefield Earth"" proportions!","I should say, ""worse than Battlefield Earth proportions!"" This whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go, ""why?"" Everything about this convoluted, sarcastic, beefed up, badly edited tripe is confusing to watch, poorly executed and loses you 10 minutes into the film. You are introduced to boring characters, cliched camera angles and material we all know John Mcteirnan is far more capable of. I was thankful I got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks! If you really want to see the real ""Rollerball"" rent (don't buy) the original. The original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loud-James Caan! He's a legend man!! I don't know what kind of future Chris Klein has in movies but as far as action movies go, let's just put it this way, we already have Keanu Reeves and quite bluntly, he's a much better actor. Steer clear and save your money!"
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!,"This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star."
1,Horrible.,I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn't.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.
1,ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.,"I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can't get any worse and then it did. <repeat> And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would."
1,"Junk, need I say more JUNK","This movie should have never been made, there is basically no story present and is just a bunch of people going around on rollerblades bashing each other's brains in. I was really looking foreword to this flick, it's previews were misleading, it looked as though it was brilliant and exciting. Guess what, it's really really really NOT!Trust me don't waste your time unless the only thing better you have to do is give the cat a bath, even then I really don't believe you should waste your time!"
2,I Hope I'm Not Allergic To It!,"I ordered this, based on the reviews. I ordered on 11/16, and received it on 11/21 (I needed it by 11/29). I love the musky smell. I only tested 1 drop on my wrist. I have to say that after a couple of hours, the smell turned into a strong sex smell... not bad, but definitely sex. I'm going to test it out at work next week, but the real test is on 11/30. I'll report my findings then.12/6/12: It works! This is definitely going to be my ""go-to"" scent. It drove my man crazy! I love it. I will purchase again."
2,concisely written,This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests. We are never going to be fluent in Russian but this little handbook makes communication possible. Thank you .
1,What the????,"It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!"
1,When Good Products Go Bad,"I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that, not the manufacturers). After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives. I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line (533/633) to buy a better one. Don't know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product."
1,Very disappointed,"Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again."
2,Very large,"These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However, for the price, I still think they are a great bargain. They are very heavy duty and will probably last many years. They are also very warm. Almost too warm here in southen California. Those people in cold climates would LOVE them! Anyhow, I would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit. But I just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine."
1,dont get it,Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man. U should wait to get the progress pet or the double soul PET.
1,Not a good toy,This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
2,JBL MRX512M,"JBL has several price points for it's professional sound reinforcement products. JRX is the least expensive and MRX is the second least expensive. The MRX series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price. These are normally $700.00 each. Amazon offered a new ""opened"" package which I was able to purchase for much less. These are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle. Power handling is between 400 and 1600 watts depending on the program. Nominal wattage is 800 watts into 8 ohms. Excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues. Speakon in and out connectors only. Non protruding handle. Great product."
1,Good for downhill only,"I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled, this only good for down hill. While it is well built, you can't propel this trike as advertized. Save your money, don't buy this!"
2,Pratchetts Best!!!!,"Since I am a literature student I am a reads-everything-I-can-get person. Having once recognized Pratchetts works, I left all my classic German literature aside and started reading and reading and reading... . But this book, ""Small Gods"", has beaten everything I've read before (even my all-time favorite ""Faust"" - you know: the Goethe one). It is witty, intelligent and above all deaply questioning. I remained nodding all the time:""Yes, that's what I always believed religion is about."""
2,Pratchett Review Haiku,I've been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here's an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky. Brutha must showthe heretics Truth.
1,Why do people like this garbage?,"Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand."
1,Boring plot.,"I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic."
1,cross contamination,"The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great ""silent damage"" to one's intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet."
2,Just Accepting Gluten Free Life,"I have read the other reviews of this book, and while I appreciate everyone's opinions I must say that this book helped me immensely! I am new to the gluten free life. I have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues. I had NO prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears. I haven't read Against the Grain, so I cannot compare the two. Jax made me laugh often, even through my tears. I recommend it for those just starting out."
1,Terrible!,"My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck's book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck's book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease."
1,get the facts,"Most of the people who gave shining, sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel. It is not boring. Jax is a talented writer, I'll give her that. But when I read on page 394 that the perscription drugs I was on and had been on for 5 years (both Pfizer drugs) were not GF I was seriously troubled.Many follow-ups with both Pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book is.I went off my meds immediately thinking I was injesting gluten. I suffered the undue consequences of going off ""cold turkey"" when I needed to taper off. In actuality those meds ARE GF, and always were!!!If you want the facts (as boring as they are) -- dont rely on this book. If you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read, but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt, as they say.Jax was indeed very lax when writing this book."
2,Thank God for Jax Peters Lowell ! !,"What a wonderful, easy book to read. And so helpful. So many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read. Not the Gluten-Free Bible. It is clear, easy-to-understand and very engaging. I really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten-free to everyday life. It is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very, very informative at the same time. I have never written a book review before, but I am so impressed with The Gluten-Free Bible that I want to share these thoughts with everyone and I intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful, witty writer. Enjoy! To your health!"
1,Not useful and a waste of money,The software does not cocur to the current USMLE pattern.It is a waste of money. The questions present on the trial CD are misleading....they do not reflect the pattern of questions inside. Do not waste your money on this!
1,Devoid of depth or even much substance,"The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight."
1,Try something else.,"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters."
2,Mr. Dickens slams industrial horror scenes.,"Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown. He writes with a sharp knife about poverty, hunger, cruel management and lack of compassion. Humor here is on the grim side."
1,Less than one star.,"Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!! Unbelievable! 2. the heroine was way too dependent upon daddy; did she not have any type of backbone? 3. The biggest, Ben knew the truth and yet he had to create all this angst on both their parts!!! YUCK!!"
1,Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game,"I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other."
2,Rivetting Sci-Fi in Paradise,"A regular nail biter: strong plotlines, excellent cast give relaible performances, killer locations. Sci-fi what-if horror flick with a twist. Who knew Tim Hutton was a sci-fi fan? Nice uncomplicated performance.,"
2,A Must Have,"For those familiar with the Burzum name, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is largely and widely accepted as his crowning achievement. Utilizing a stunning mixture of layered guitar melodies, gloomy synths, and thunderous percussion, Varg works his way through three hypnotic metal songs before the ambitious ambient outro - Tomhet. Rather than sit here and rattle on about the magic contained within this record, I would rather just claim that it is a must have for any black metal fan, and ranks among the highest calibur or metal releases period."
2,Super Reader,"An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos, a la John Myers Myers' Silverlock.Dracula has found another way to be in charge in England, by marrying in to the royal family. To prevent problems, he has had the Great Detective thrown in a prison camp.So when a serial killed called Silver Knife is killing vampire whores, it falls to the Diogenes Club to investigate. Vampires heal normal wounds, but not silver. The investigation uncovers a lot more than just a chain of killings."
1,Politics?,"A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read."
2,A Must for Handgunners - Old and New,"This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive. But it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts. See alsoThe Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About Guns, Crime, and the Second Amendment."
1,Lousy Camera,"This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally ""twisted"".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one."
1,Piece of junk,Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
2,Video too!,I was very impressed with it. It take stills and movie clips great and it so small. Great pocket p.c. add on .
2,Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!,"This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the ""best"" of Motown, in which the Holland/Dozier/Holland tagline under the title of the record meant high quality R&B;, and almost always resulted in a mega-hit. The collection begins with the very earliest hit -- Eddie Holland singing ""Jamie"", and proceeds through most of the major early hits of The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Mary Wells, The Marvalettes, The 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, and more.This CD replaces my old collection of 45 RPM recordings, and has allowed me to enjoy the Motown Sound without haaving a huge number of CD's to collect. The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: ""My World is Empty Without You"" and ""Forever Came Today"". In all, the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories: The soundtrack to my teenage years; Rock On!!"
2,Great true crime read,"I really have to give this author credit, as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin's killers, and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother. The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read."
1,static central,"Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices, speakers and headphones, and all have the same result, static. Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $3 shipped to begin with."
1,I expected something better,"EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that's what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I've long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn't get what they expected based on the product description, I think it's safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I'd buy from another shipper."
1,Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail,"Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first ""click"" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones."
1,Freud is crazy!,"I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so."
2,"If life is a dream, then don't wake me up","This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work."
2,It arriived,Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d
2,Barely Unbeatable Theory,"Freud's ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory."
2,When did Grandpa die and what do we tell the kids?,"Grandma and a brother? That's just weird. I'm a Grandfather of a Five year old Granddaughter and I, I!, bought my Granddaughter the dollhouse and the full set of house furniture. What the, no, wtf were they thinking? Simpletons rule the fricking world. Grandma? Grandpa. Brother? Sister. Idiots.That said my Granddaughter loves this entire set. Full on wonderful for her, and yes if they came out with Grandpa with a sister I would buy both sets, throw the older brother away and give her the rest so maybe their not idiots, just soulless vampires."
1,Amazon.com sent wrong size,Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
2,One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.,"This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here. What is here is his last composition, the “Hesperus-Bahnen Waltz”, published as Op 279, after the forty-three year old composer’s death."
2,"Janet, is the Best female singer!","I watched The Velvet rope tour on HBO and it was the bomb, it was the greatest tour that I have ever seen, everything was choreographed pefectly, the music was slammin and Janet really communicated with her fans. When she sang ""I get Lonely"", ""Nasty"" and ""You"", it sent me Crazy. I love you Janet!"
2,Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!,"If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a ""must have"" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!"
2,Captivating,"Very simply, I was unable to put this book down. Not unlike some of the other reviewers I too was on my way to Boston on business whilst reading this ""glued to my seat"" book. For the first time, I can say that I was pleased for all the flight delays as I managed to finish reading this book on route. I am an avid reader and can say without reservation that Rapid Descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors, such as Crichton, Grisham, Cook etc to name a few of my favorites. Well Done Dr. Jack when's the next one....."
2,Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.,"Yes, by reading every review we all know by now that Sheri is a wee bit annoying, and her ""participants"" are an interesting sort of people, AND YES it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it. BUT everything in this DVD is so valuable! I learned everything I needed to know through this DVD without taking more time off work to go to classes. And since it was always available to me by the touch of a button I was able to review the important things while I was acually in labor. I had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be 5 mins apart before we went to the hospital, so I popped in the DVD, and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance, he was taking notes! This was my first child and thanks to Sheri my labor was only 12 hour and I only pushed for 20 mins, 3 good ones and he was out! I think doing what Sheri says and waiting till your dialated 5 cm before you get an epideral was really key."
2,Great Information,My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We've been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.
2,Good Overview and Very Informative,"I really enjoyed this DVD, it provided good content at a nice pace. I highly recommend this DVD."
2,Superb!,"When I was 5 months pregnant, I'm desperate to take Child Birth Class in order to help me have Normal Delivery. I searched over the net the best detailed class. Voila! I came accross this product on one of my searches. I never had second thoughts of ordering this product. I regularly viewed and applied all the techniques taught on DVD. It really works! I had an easy labor plus I had Normal Delivery. Superb! I recommend this DVD for those who wanted a Modern and comprehensive Child Birth Class. - Margery Bermejo (Davao City, Philippines)"
2,Chilbirth Education Video,Great videos!!!! I'm a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch! They helped my daughter prepare for her first labor and delivery experience. They also helped review and update me on current L and D practices. Thanks for a wonderful product!
1,TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH,"I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest."
2,GO FOR IT!,"This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman, why not?) The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it's growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it's like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn't be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!"
2,LOVED this video!,"After I bought this DVD, I watched it about 8 times on my own and with my husband before our son was born. We both laughed at Sheri's mannerisms but really loved all we learned from her. We both felt more prepared, even though we weren't able to attend birthing classes."
2,RECOMMEND!,"I was going for a med-free birth...not for any reason other than I wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and I and I figured I could do it as well. It's what our bodies are meant to do, right? Well, this DVD was great! It saved me from paying over $100 for a lamaze class and I felt the stuff she touched on for the lamaze section was perfect. I did not have a doula or a midwife...just my husband, an awesome nurse and this DVD. I enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch. It's a bit OUTDATED, and CHEESY, but overall very honest and good. Worked for me. If anything, its worht the few $$ for reference AFTER a birthing class. (I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, b/c they should really look into updating it soon)."
1,Couldn't finish watching,"Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes, but wanted a refresher before the big event. While the information is consistent with what we've learned from other professionals - the presenter is terribly annoying. Although we wanted the information, the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching. If you can deal with the presenter's sense of humor, you'll benefit from the information - good luck!"
2,very informative,"Laugh and Learn About Childbirthexcellent information, and humorous all at the same time !!!"
2,Poignant & Intelligent -- give this one a listen!,"Ron's playful and probing musicality emerges in this album with the no-holds-barred clairvoyance I came to expect after he wrote and performed two film scores for me. I find him to be a certifiable, bonafide talent -- one of life's genuine little treasures secreted away in the mountains of Montana. In a way I am [selfishly] sorry to hear his album is realizing such widespread success -- I was kind of hoping to keep him all to myself."
2,"Exquisitely fresh, jazzy & melodius, crisp & classy!","Mysterious jazz that rolls into the imaginary worlds of a Native American dance, a smokey Nashville nightclub, a cruise with the whales...hints of Paul Consort with a crisp and haunting classical foundation, a journey through the 20th Century...and back again into the lonely Montana night where Ron strolls with star gazing abandon."
1,At least it's free,"I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though..."
2,Yardbirds,"Very informative and fun to listen to for someone of my generation. I had heard bits and pieces of the Yardbirds story, but never the complete picture."
2,One of my favorites...,"...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in ""Revenge"". So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, ""got-nothing-else-to-do"" movies.It's definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right. Give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2,"Nice French farce, similar to 'un elephant'","Showed this film to my French class, and it was a hit. The same actors as in Jean de Florette, but about 20 years later. Thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Daniel Auteuil is fabulous,I've been a fan of Daniel Auteuil for some time and look forward to each new movie. This one is very funny and entertaining.
1,This book is AWEFUL,"I read this book 3-4 years ago. It's still makes me highly agitated every time I think about it. You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended."
2,Captivating and Engrossing,"When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong, self-assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing. I have given this book to my sisters and to several friends. And whenever I get into a discussion about 'good books' this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa. He wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english. And this was the first book I thouht to send him. Well that and a dictionary.Thanks to Jean Auel for writing such a great novel."
2,Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!!!!!,"I first read Clan of the Cave Bear when I was prompted by my mom.I thought ""another one of your lousy stories"" I read the first page and I was enthralled!! I simply could not take my eyes off the page!!I am a 12-year-old living in Kars,Ontario,and I reccommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!!!!Nobody writes like Jean M. Not ever.This book made me laugh,as well as cry. I have read all of her books,and am eagerly awaiting her 5th book.I love this book! I would give it 10000000 stars,if possible. If anyone dares to insult her work in my presence......."
2,one of the best series EVER!!!,"When my dad first gave me this book to read, it had the orignal cover, and was sort of deteriorating, and I had a feeling that I woudln't really like it. That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it's hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!"
1,Giants Mats,The blue portion of the mats was a different blue. It looked more like a navy blue which I found very disappointing because that's like having a pair of bootleg mats.
2,Exactly what I ordered,"Product arrived on time, in great condition. As usual, Amazon provided a vehicle to acquire a product that I wanted."
2,Touching,"Beautiful film, excellent acting. The story transports you to other worlds to experience the full gamut of emotions. These are real people with real issues, another example of life being stranger than fiction, as portrayed in a film. Hope there's a Part II. :)"
2,One of the best foreign language films,"For once, a film coming from a north european country that is neither unhealthy nor perverse.Suzanne Bier is a wonderful director as she proved in two of my favorite films ""Things we lost in the fire"" and ""Brothers""."
2,Wonderfully emotional.,Great story line. The pacing of the plot was well thought out (sometimes rather predictable) but the actors really brought a sense of honesty.
1,The remix is different,"I own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier CD release. I am always a sucker for a remaster, so decided what the heck. I chose poorly - the remixes just don't sound right. For all I know, this 2006 version was the original intent, I hope not."
1,Why the remix?,"If a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like Pearl Jam did with their recent re-release of 10, not replace the original album mix like Mushroom is doing here. This new remix is not as good as the original versions of these songs. Wish they would remaster the original mix and issue it."
1,Art and Passion...but no Science,"A series of short vignettes about fencing, none detailed enough to impart and real knowledge. A definite lack of technical instruction on fencing. Not sure who this video would be useful for...certainly not a beginner trying to learn about the technical aspects of the sport."
1,No illustrations,"The Kindle version has no illustrations, and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses. The limericks appear without logical line shifts, and where the illustration is supposed to be, it just says [illustration] which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all.It's free, but it's hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it, at least for me."
1,No drawings!,"I love love loved Edward Lear but unfortunately this free copy doesn't have the marvelous drawings. It would be better to get another edition of this wonderful book, one that is illustrated."
2,what hard rock is all about,"Cut the crap! it's motorhead, it's rock n' roll, loud, dirty, agressive, but also a singalong album.By far, my favourite Motorhead album, actually the only one that still survives in my collection nowadays.many eternal hard rock classics that must be listened by every metal, hard rock, stoner fan of the XXI century.check out Overkill, stay clean, no class, i'll be your sister, metropolis."
2,Thuvia maid of mars,"Typical ERB Mars series, which I find light reading. Not too much depth or thought provoking, but nice escape from everyday."
